st.subheader("Abstract")
st.write("The open-source PlanetProfile framework was developed to investigate the interior structure of icy moons based on collectively matching their observed properties and comparative planetology. \
The software relates observed and measured properties, assumptions such as the type of materials present, and laboratory equation-of-state (EOS) data through geophysical and thermodynamic models \
to evaluate radial profiles of mechanical, thermodynamic, and electrical properties, as self-consistently as possible.")
